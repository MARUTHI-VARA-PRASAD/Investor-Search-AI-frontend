This project was undertaken as an assignment for Energy Alternatives India as part of the AI for Climate Tech Internship position. As someone who is a beginner in learning how AI can be incorporated into web applications in general, the aim of this exercise was to develop a small-scale frontend-focused application which provides an initial insight into the usage of AI concepts.

It enables the user to input the sector and country, and by clicking one button, the system returns the investor recommendations generated by the AI along with the reason behind the recommendations. This project is not concerned with the complex implementation, such as the development of the architecture, focus being on learning the process of linking the front end with the AI API while ensuring proper designs.

All the given tasks can be achieved using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design of the project will be card-based with a background image, which will ensure a better user experience.

AI API Used

-- This project uses the OpenRouter API for AI text generation.

-- OpenRouter provides access to OpenAI-compatible language models through a simple REST API.

-- The AI is used to generate the top three investor suggestions based on the user’s input.
